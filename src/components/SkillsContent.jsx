            As a recent graduate from Full Stack Academy's coding bootcamp and
            Virginia Commonwealth University, I'm excited to embark on my
            journey as a software engineer! I've gained experience in a diverse
            suite of technologies, and I'm eager to use these skills to create
            fantastic applications. My love for photography and technology fuels
            my drive to innovate, and I enjoy blending creativity with function
            to deliver engaging user experiences. With a solid foundation in
            full-stack development, I'm looking forward to collaborating,
            learning, and growing as I begin my career in this industry!
